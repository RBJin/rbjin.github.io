I am Renbiao Jin (金仁标), a PhD student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Under the guidance of Prof. [Wenxian Yu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenxian-Yu) and Prof. [Danping Zou](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?hl=zh-TW&user=y6FsLDQAAAAJ), my research focuses on 3D Computer Vision, particularly in visual feature extraction, matching, and optical flow for SLAM and Localization. My work aims to enhance the robustness, efficiency, and accuracy of SLAM systems, with applications in areas such as drone navigation and mixed reality.
